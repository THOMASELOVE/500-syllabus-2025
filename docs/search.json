    "text": "5.3 A Few Tips from Professor Love\n\nStatistics is a “getting the details right” business - we care deeply about details, and this applies to writing code or complete English sentences. RStudio has a spell-checker. To use it, click F7.\nNothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables.\nDon’t parrot back material that Professor Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in my words is, technically, plagiarism.\nEdit your more adventurous output; don’t present everything you know how to do in R, and don’t forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results.\nMake your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary.\nClearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate.\nSimplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well.\nData are plural. Use “the data are …” rather than ``the data is … ’’\nA paragraph must contain more than one sentence.\n\nDon’t switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout.\nDon’t write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result.\nSimilarly, don’t defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in.\nIf you want to write that you used \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) as your significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval.\n\nIf you find yourself in the appalling situation of writing about a p-value, then you should state something like:\n\n[1] We’re using a 95% confidence level.\n[2] We’re using a 5% significance level.\n\n[3] We’re using \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).\n\nDon’t use more than one of these expressions.\n\nAgain, don’t use p-values in most settings, but if you must, refer to all p-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), rather than, for instance, \\(p = 0.00000001\\) or, worse yet, \\(p = 0\\). In a similar vein, write all \\(p\\)-values that exceed 0.99 as \\(p &gt; 0.99\\) instead of, for instance, \\(p  = 1\\).\nTo the extent possible, don’t use computer-ese to label variables, plots or tables. R and Markdown allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things – do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage.\nWhen in doubt, err on the side of clarity. Clear thinking, clear writing.",

Unauthorized absence from a final examination will result in a failing grade. When the student completes the work, the Incomplete is changed to an A, B, C, D, P, F, or NP.\nAll work for the incomplete grade must be made up and the change of grade recorded in the Office of the University Registrar by the date specified by the instructor, but no later than the last day of class in the semester following the one in which the Incomplete was received. A student who has a permanent Incomplete for a required course must retake the course in a later term.

    "text": "6.3 Laptop and cell phone use\nAlthough having a laptop in class opens up new learning possibilities for students, it can be used in ways that are inappropriate. It is easy for your laptop to become a distraction to you and to those around you. Laptops are to be used only when essential to the task at hand. Please turn off or silence all cell/smart phones, tablets, and other electronic devices for the duration of the course. Inappropriate uses will be noted and may affect the final grade.",

    "text": "6.4 Diversity and Inclusion\nIt is the intent that all students regardless of their background and perspective be well-served by this class. Further, we intend to present material whose content is respectful of diversity (gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture) and deliver it in a way that respects these differences as well. We expect that all students, instructors and guests will help foster an atmosphere of respect, trust and safety in the classroom.\nIf you have suggestions for how to make the class content or environment more inclusive, or have specific incidents to report, please reach out to the instructor. If you are not comfortable reaching out to the instructor, feel free to reach out to someone else, such as the School of Medicine Graduate Education Office (som-geo@case.edu) or the Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equal Opportunity (OIDEO) (oideo@case.edu).\nMore information on University policy and resources are available on OIDEO’s website at https://case.edu/diversity/.",

    "text": "6.5 Academic Integrity\nAny violation of the University’s Code of Ethics will not be tolerated. All forms of academic dishonesty including cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation, and obstruction are violations of academic integrity standards and will result in a minimum penalty of receiving a zero for the assignment, the potential for failing the entire course. Cheating includes copying from another’s work, falsifying problem solutions or laboratory reports, or using unauthorized sources, notes or computer programs. Plagiarism includes the presentation, without proper attribution, of another’s words or ideas from printed or electronic sources. It is also plagiarism to submit, without the instructor’s consent, an assignment in one class previously submitted in another. Misrepresentation includes forgery of official academic documents, the presentation of altered or falsified documents or testimony to a university office or official, taking an exam for another student, or lying about personal circumstances to postpone tests or assignments. Obstruction occurs when a student engages in unreasonable conduct that interferes with another’s ability to conduct scholarly activity. Destroying a student’s computer file, stealing a student’s notebook, and stealing a book on reserve in the library are examples of obstruction.\nIn addition, the incident will be reported to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and Academic Review Board for undergraduates or Senior Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, for Graduate Students.\nThe CWRU Statement of Ethics for graduate students can be found here: http://case.edu/gradstudies/about-the-school/policies-procedures/",

    "text": "6.6 Plagiarism\nUnless specifically stated otherwise, the faculty of the PQHS expect and require original writing for all assignments given. Submitting plagiarized work for an academic requirement is a violation of the academic integrity standards set forth by the University. Plagiarism is the representation of another’s work or ideas as one’s own; it includes the unacknowledged, word-for-word use and/or paraphrasing of another person’s work, and/or the inappropriate unacknowledged use of another person’s ideas. Submitting substantially the same work to satisfy requirements for one course that has been submitted in satisfaction of requirements for another course, without permission of the instructor of the course for which the work is being submitted, is also prohibited.",
