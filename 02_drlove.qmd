## A More Complete Biography 

Hi. I am Thomas E. Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs.

- I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population & Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics.
- I direct [Biostatistics and Data Science](http://chrp.org/biostatistics-evaluation/) at the [Population Health Research Institute](https://www.metrohealth.org/population-health-research-institute) and at the [Center for Health Care Research and Policy](https://www.metrohealth.org/population-health-research-institute/center-for-health-care-research-and-policy) at [The MetroHealth System](https://www.metrohealth.org/).
- For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for [Better Health Partnership](http://betterhealthpartnership.org/), an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I now serve as Chief Data Scientist there.
- I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research, including the 2018 [John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching](https://students.case.edu/traditions/awards/diekhoff/) from CWRU.
- I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management.

In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records.

- You may be interested in a [recent study in Health Affairs](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/34/7/1121.abstract) showing the impact of a [Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland](http://thedaily.case.edu/new-study-shows-prepared-safety-net-improves-care-saves-money-in-medicaid-expansion-population/).
- Or you might be interested in our [New England Journal of Medicine study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1102519) of the effect of electronic health records on the care and outcomes of people with diabetes.
- In 2011, [James O'Malley](http://tdi.dartmouth.edu/faculty/a-james-omalley-phd) and I chaired the [Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/ichps/2011/index.cfm?fuseaction=main), here in Cleveland. Here's a [recap](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10742-012-0096-8). 
- I've also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure.

I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman who is an attorney at Savant Systems, and we are raising two terrific sons. The elder lives and works in Pittsburgh and the younger is in his third year at Columbia University, my alma mater. We live in Shaker Heights. I sing and act occasionally in [community theater](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater).
